Hi, My name is Philip Ronin Villanueva Uriarte.

During my summer OJT I worked as a Mobile Developer Intern at Highly Succeed
Inc. where I gained practical experience in Android  mobile development using
using Kotlin and Android Studio. Beyond coding, coding, I assumed a
leadership role as an intern team lead, overseeing project management, 
attendance, and reporting.

For hobbies I like to read books and play video games. My favorite book series
is "A Song of Ice and Fire" by George R.R. Martin. My favorite game is Dark 
Souls 1. I've been listening to a wide variety of music lately but the band 
whose music I never get tired of is Paramore. My favorite movies are "Her", 
"La La Land", and "Inception".
